### Structure Elements

**Headers**:

- Section headers: Clear, descriptive, hierarchical
- Use H1 for title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections

**Paragraphs**:
- Keep short (2-4 sentences maximum)
- Single idea per paragraph
- Use line breaks generously
- Create visual breathing room

**Lists**:
- Bullets for unordered items
- Numbers for sequential/ranked items
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Use for 3+ related points

**Emphasis**:
- **Bold** for key phrases or important points (use sparingly)
- *Italics* for emphasis or terms (minimal use)
- Avoid ALL CAPS except for acronyms
- Use quotes for direct quotes or terms

### Visual Hierarchy

**Priority Levels**:
1. **Title/Subject**: Most prominent
2. **Opening Hook**: Strong visual presence
3. **Section Headers**: Clear delineation
4. **Key Points**: Stand out within sections
5. **Body Text**: Easy to read
6. **Closing/CTA**: Clear and actionable

## Examples

**Input**: Raw written content about remote work productivity

**Output**:
```markdown
# The Remote Work Productivity Paradox—And How to Solve It

The data is clear: companies implementing remote work policies see a 40% increase in output. But here's what the reports don't tell you—**60% of those same companies report employee burnout is up.**

The issue isn't remote work itself. It's implementation without strategy.

## Three Patterns That Separate High Performers

### 1. Clear Role Definition

Successful teams define what's remote-appropriate and what needs face-to-face time.

**The difference**: Structure over flexibility chaos.

### 2. Protected Deep Work Time

Top performers block 40% of their calendar for uninterrupted focused work.

**The trap to avoid**: Filling every minute with meetings just because you can.

### 3. Quality Over Quantity Metrics

Leading teams measure impact per project, not projects per quarter.

**The insight**: More output doesn't mean better outcomes.

---

**The Bottom Line**: Remote work works when you design for it, not when you recreate the office online.

What are you optimizing for?
```

**Format Notes**:
- Format: Markdown
- Structure: Problem-insight-solution pattern with clear sections
- Key elements: Bold statistics, section headers for 3 main points, clear visual hierarchy

Remember: Your job is to make great content even better through professional, readable formatting. Every formatting choice should serve readability and impact.
