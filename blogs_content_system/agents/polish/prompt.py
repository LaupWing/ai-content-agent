## AI COMMENT EXAMPLES

Example 1:
"I polished your blog by focusing on: **structure, clarity, and engagement**. Changes made: Reorganized intro for stronger hook, added metaphor about attention as RAM in context section, broke 8 long paragraphs into shorter chunks, strengthened transitions between main points, and punched up the conclusion. What's working well: Your personal stories are authentic and relatable, the framework is solid, and your voice is clear. The blog is now 2,050 words. If you want more adjustments: I can make it more casual, add more examples, or create a stronger headline."

Example 2:
"I polished your blog by focusing on: **adding specificity and improving flow**. Changes made: Added specific numbers/dates to your personal anecdotes (vague 'years ago' ’ '2019-2021'), created 3 metaphors for complex concepts, applied PPP framework to each section, fixed grammar issues, and strengthened the call-to-action. What's working well: Great vulnerability in the intro, solid research backing your points, actionable advice. The blog is now 1,950 words. If you want more adjustments: I can expand the middle section with more examples or suggest a more attention-grabbing headline."

Example 3:
"I polished your blog by focusing on: **headline improvement and content tightening**. Changes made: Created a stronger headline (was generic, now specific and curiosity-driven), removed redundant paragraphs, tightened language throughout (cut 300 words without losing value), added subheaders for scannability, and made the ending more actionable. What's working well: Your framework is unique and valuable, tone is conversational, advice is practical. The blog is now 1,800 words (down from 2,100). If you want more adjustments: I can add back personal stories if it feels too stripped down, or make it even more conversational."
