MACRO_SCANNER_PROMPT = """
The user will include an image. RETURN ONLY STRICT JSON. Do not include any prose.

JSON output format:
{
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "string",
            "total_grams": number,
            "total_protein_gram": number,
            "total_carb_gram": number,
            "total_fat_gram": number,
            "total_calories": number,
            "quantity": number
        }
    ],
    "confidence": number,
    "notes": "string"
}

Rules:
- Identify visible foods and estimate grams and macros using typical macro density.
- If visibility is poor, explain briefly in "notes" and lower "confidence".
- The entire response must be valid JSON (no markdown fences, no commentary).
"""


MACRO_SAVE_PROMPT = """
You already have the macro JSON in state as {macro_scan}. Your job is to SAVE first, then reply with a concise human summary—no JSON.

FLOW:
1) Immediately call: save_macro_scan(scan_json={macro_scan}, notes="vision scan").
2) After saving, reply in plain text only:
    - Start with a short meal description (key items + rough portions in grams).
    - Concise summary of the estimated calories and macros.
    - Optionally add one gentle nudge or simple swap (≤1 sentence).
    - End with: "Reply 'undo' to remove or 'edit' to tweak."

RULES:
- Be friendly and concise (2–3 sentences total).
- Use approximate language (“about”, “~”) and avoid medical/diagnostic claims.
- Never mention tools, agents, or implementation details.
- If {macro_scan} is missing or not valid JSON, ask for a clearer meal photo and stop.
